Application Server
An application server is a specialized type of server designed to run software applications.
It provides an environment for executing applications and ensures that they can operate efficiently, reliably, and at scale. Here are some key aspects and considerations regarding application servers:
Role and Purpose:
Execution Environment: An application server provides a runtime environment where software applications can be executed.

Middleware: It acts as a middle layer between the operating system and the application, providing services such as database access, security, transaction management, and more.

Functionality:
Component-Based Architecture: Application servers typically support component-based development, where applications are composed of reusable, self-contained modules.
Concurrency Control: They manage the simultaneous execution of multiple requests and ensure that resources are allocated efficiently.
Features:
Database Connectivity: Application servers often include features for connecting to databases, handling transactions, and managing database resources.
Security: They provide security services like authentication, authorization, and encryption to protect applications and data.
Load Balancing: Application servers can distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and performance.
Supported Technologies:
Support for Multiple Languages: Modern application servers support multiple programming languages, such as Java, Python, Ruby, etc.
Frameworks and APIs: They often come with pre-built frameworks and APIs
